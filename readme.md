This repository is meant to help others learn about Bayesian and Frequentist methods often used in applied statistics. I focus particularly on explaining the connections between different concepts in order to help the reader build intuition around the fundamentals. My hope is that this will be particularly helpful for any data scientist who wants to brush up on the fundamentals of testing. I hope you enjoy it!
